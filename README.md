Git Help:
1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (PC) and "cd" into the mggg folder. Usually the path is cd Desktop/.../mggg
2. Always make sure to type "git pull" before you start working on any files or pushing. This ensures that your local files are up to date with the ones on Github.
3. To push after you make changes or add a new file:
	
	a. type in Terminal "git status" and see which files show up as modified (colored red)
	
	b. type "git add [INSERT FILE NAME]" to stage the modified file
	
	c. type "git status" and the staged file should be green
	
	d. type "git commit -m [INSERT MESSAGE HERE ]" to commit the files. Make sure the message is in quotes.
	
	e. type "git push" to update the Github with your modified local files

4. Check on the online Github repository to see if everything is up to date!
